But one night, during a silent tea-phase beneath the central chamber, a young disciple dared to twist the beat. He rolled dice - not out of curiosity, but desperation. He had wagered basil, blood, and ritual favor… and lost. He did not leave. He stayed, rolling ghost dice across cracked tiles, whispering that the next round would restore balance, that this time, the Sahur rhythm would beat in his favor. Instead, he decayed - flesh vanished, but hope calcified, rotting into a skeletal plea that never stops. And so he became what the monks now call: NOOOO BROOOO I NEED TO WIN BROO",

As an aside, the original Indonesian description is very detailed, but as you can see, you don't want to pay for the data. In general, it seems to have satirized the facts that use other people's cellular data, such as begging for hot spots to use only messenger apps for others, and connecting hotspots.
